/**
 * You receive a signal directly from the CPU. Because of your recent assistance with jump instructions, it would like
 * you to compute the result of a series of unusual register instructions.
 *
 * Each instruction consists of several parts: the register to modify, whether to increase or decrease that register's
 * value, the amount by which to increase or decrease it, and a condition. If the condition fails, skip the instruction
 * without modifying the register. The registers all start at 0. The instructions look like this:
 *
 * b inc 5 if a > 1
 * a inc 1 if b < 5
 * c dec -10 if a >= 1
 * c inc -20 if c == 10
 *
 * These instructions would be processed as follows:
 *
 * - Because a starts at 0, it is not greater than 1, and so b is not modified.
 * - a is increased by 1 (to 1) because b is less than 5 (it is 0).
 * - c is decreased by -10 (to 10) because a is now greater than or equal to 1 (it is 1).
 * - c is increased by -20 (to -10) because c is equal to 10.
 *
 * After this process, the largest value in any register is 1.
 *
 * You might also encounter <= (less than or equal to) or != (not equal to). However, the CPU doesn't have the
 * bandwidth to tell you what all the registers are named, and leaves that to you to determine.
 *
 * What is the largest value in any register after completing the instructions in your puzzle input?
